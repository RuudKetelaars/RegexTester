# RegexTester

RegexTester is a open-source (GPLv3) tool for testing regular expressions.

The project was started because I couldn't find a good tool for testing regular expressions and with creating my own tool I can also add additional options.

It uses:
- [Ude](https://github.com/errepi/ude) to detect the file encoding when opening a text file.
- [FastColoredTextBox](https://github.com/PavelTorgashov/FastColoredTextBox) for color highlighting the matches.
